/**
 * A Map is a two-dimensional layout of tiles. The actual
 * interlocking of tiles is left to subclasses.
 * 
 * Note that many games are more easily implemented with several
 * "layers" of Maps. For example, a simple stragegy game may contain
 * three seperate maps:
 *
 *    + World Map: Tiles contain "Terrain" tiles that display a
 *         graphic and have associated stat modifiers.
 *
 *    + Overlay Map: Tiles contain a semi-transparent bitmap to show
 *         the area-of-effect for an action.
 *
 *    + Player Map: Tiles contain "Player" objects that define
 *         interacting characters.
