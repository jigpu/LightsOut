/**
 * The EventPublisher is in charge of dispatching SDL_Events
 * all interested parties. This class makes the SDL event queue
 * thread friendly, since SDL_PollEvent removes events from
 * the queue (meaning that only one caller will ever get the
 * message).
 *
 * EventPublisher is a singleton, since multiple publishers
 * would end up competing over the single event queue (which
 * is precicely what we wanted to avoid!).
 *
 * This class replaces the old Controller class since it was
 * essentially just a specialized event publisher.
