/**
 * A CachedRenderable is a Renderable which holds onto a surface
 * containing the last clean render of itself. If the object is not
 * dirty then rendering speed is greatly increased (only one blit
 * need occur, and no further painting of children is necessary).
 * 
 * CachedRenderable is an ideal superclass for objects which do not
 * get dirty often (whether by themselves or from their children).
 * Objects which are very often dirty may actually have slower render
 * times.
